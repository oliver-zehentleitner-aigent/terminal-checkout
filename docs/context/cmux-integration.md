# cmux integration

How the app reaches a cmux server, what it is allowed to ask of it, and what it deliberately does not do. The mechanisms and the measured pitfalls live in `CLAUDE.md`; this file holds the forks. Everything here was measured against cmux v0.64.22 unless an entry says otherwise.

## The socket control mode is the user's setting, and the app stopped short of writing it

**Type:** decision

**Evidence:** confirmed
**Source:** PR #60; `app/Sources/App/CmuxConfigHelp.swift`; denial measured from an external shell
**Revisit when:** cmux gains a supported way for an outside process to request automation mode, or `cmux settings automation` stops requiring a socket that automation mode is what grants

cmux only accepts socket commands from processes it can prove are its own descendants, so the app cannot talk to it until the user sets `socketControlMode` to `automation` in `~/.config/cmux/cmux.json`. General's Connection Details popover copies the JSON fragment to the clipboard and opens that file — or its folder if the file does not exist yet — and writes nothing.

**Reason:** the default mode (`cmuxOnly`) authorizes by walking the peer pid's ancestor chain up to the cmux server. An app launched through LaunchServices is never in that chain, by construction, so no amount of care on our side makes the default mode work. `automation` removes only the ancestry test and keeps the same-uid test, which is the boundary the app's own socket already uses — so it adds no trust boundary that this machine did not already have. `password` and `allowAll` also pass, and the app does not object to them.

**Rejected alternative — write `cmux.json` for the user.** This was built and shipped inside this loop, then removed: a timestamped `.bak`, a JSONC text-splice edit that preserved comments and other keys rather than parsing and re-serializing, a 0600 temp file, an atomic replace, and a live `cmux ping` to confirm the daemon picked it up. It came out again because of what it cost to keep honest — roughly half the findings of the first seven cold-review rounds landed on this one feature (18 of them), and every failure mode it produced was of the same three kinds: damaging a file the app does not own, widening a permission on the user's behalf, or reporting a success the app had not actually verified. Removing it deleted 417 lines of edit logic, 387 of config parsing and 677 of tests, and left the feature the user actually needs: knowing which value to set and where.

**Rejected alternative — delegate to `cmux settings automation`.** The obvious escape from hand-editing JSON, and it does not work in the state where it is needed: measured from an external shell while `socketControlMode` was still `cmuxOnly`, the CLI answered `Error: ERROR: Access denied - only processes started inside cmux can connect`. The subcommand goes through the same socket that automation mode is what unlocks, so it can only turn on a setting that is already on.

**Rejected alternative — harvest a capability token.** cmux mints bearer tokens in the environment of the panes it starts, and they do not expire, so a token read out of a pane would authorize us without any setting being changed. Rejected on the boundary rather than on feasibility: it takes a credential from a context that never offered it, through an interface cmux does not support for this. Feasibility was never established either — the closest measurement, made while looking for the tty, is that `ps -E` does not show a system binary's environment at all.

**Rejected alternative — recommend `allowAll`.** It also lifts the ancestry test, and it does so by making the socket world-accessible. `automation` is the narrowest mode that solves the actual problem.

**Consequence, accepted:** cmux costs zero macOS TCC permissions — the same grade as WezTerm — in exchange for one setting the user changes by hand, once. A second consequence is diagnostic: with no socket the app cannot tell "cmux is not running" from "cmux refused us," so it never reads the settings file to guess which one it is; `Access denied` is reported as itself, because launching cmux cannot fix it.

## Only an oversized send waits for raw mode, because the writer cannot see the truncation

**Revisit when:** cmux exposes a reliable indication that the shell line editor is reading the new surface

When raw mode is observed, any payload is sent immediately. Without that observation, a payload at or below the 1024-byte canonical limit is sent immediately because Darwin's canonical buffer preserves the complete payload, including CR; only a larger payload waits for raw mode, and if raw mode is still not observed at the deadline it is refused before `surface.send_text`.

**Reason:** canonical mode keeps exactly 1024 bytes of an unread line and silently discards the rest, including CR, even though the writer sees every byte as accepted. A 1023-byte payload plus CR survives whole, so waiting for raw mode adds no safety to a payload within the limit. The 2026-08-30 unified log measured the cost of that wait on a slow shell-integration pane: a 24.7-second button press spent 10.4 seconds in this gate, and its 317-byte payload was sent the same way after the deadline.

**Rejected alternative — always send immediately.** This remains rejected for payloads over the 1024-byte limit: before raw mode, the canonical buffer can silently discard the excess and CR. The measured risk does not apply to payloads within the limit, so those now use immediate send.

**Rejected alternative — truncate based on length.** The app would change the user's command and still would not make the resulting command correct.

**Rejected alternative — always wait until the deadline.** A slow but healthy shell would add the full ten-second delay to every command, including payloads that could be sent safely; this concern precisely predicted the 2026-08-30 defect, where 10.4 seconds of a 24.7-second button press bought no additional safety for a 317-byte payload.

**Rejected alternative — send the text first and CR later.** The canonical buffer has already crossed its 1024-byte boundary before CR is sent, so delaying CR cannot restore the discarded bytes.

**Consequence, accepted:** payloads within the canonical limit leave immediately regardless of shell preparation; if the pty does not yet exist, cmux may queue the payload and flush it after warm-up (measured for `focus:false`), but a focused create also returned `queued:false` while `tty` was still null, while oversized payloads still wait for raw mode and fail visibly before transmission instead of being silently altered in the pane. Removing the command-gate wait means the scheduled Claude-input tty discovery deadline now carries the full window alone, so it is 30 seconds; previously the 10-second gate plus the 20-second discovery deadline happened to total the same amount. The `.refuseTooLong` path occurs after `workspace.create`, so it leaves one empty tab; that is accepted because a visible failure is safer than silent truncation and the error still reaches the button.

## Each cmux channel is pinned to its own socket, because discovery crosses channels

**Revisit when:** cmux changes its per-channel pointer files or makes CLI discovery channel-safe without an explicit socket

Stable and NIGHTLY each write the same live socket path to two pointer files. The state-directory candidate is read first, followed by the `/tmp` candidate, and the first candidate whose target exists is passed through `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH`; the state copy is preferred because `/tmp` is periodically cleaned, while `/tmp` remains the only clue when state is absent. The socket basename is never cached as a fixed name, so each new request and launch retry resolves the candidates again, while later RPCs keep the target that created the surface. If the selected channel has no live pointer but another channel does, the app does not use unpinned discovery; if neither channel has a live pointer, `.discover` preserves the existing single-channel behavior.

> Superseded 2026-08: the fixed-name `cmux.sock` lookup is superseded by channel-specific socket-pointer resolution.

**Reason:** both channel binaries contain the names of all channel pointer files, and an unpinned NIGHTLY CLI reached the stable server while both were running. A pointer target is the only measured channel-specific socket identity, so carrying it from workspace creation through readiness, input, screen reads, and the setup ping keeps the server that answers deterministic.

**Rejected alternative — keep the fixed name `cmux.sock`.** That name was stale on this machine after a restart, while the live basename had changed.

**Rejected alternative — ignore the pointer and use CLI auto-discovery.** The cross-channel PONG measurement shows that auto-discovery can answer from the wrong server.

**Rejected alternative — use different CLIs but share one socket.** Choosing the right executable does not constrain the server when the CLI itself performs unpinned discovery, so the same cross-channel error remains.

**Rejected alternative — discover whenever the selected channel has no pointer.** With the selected channel stopped and the other channel running, this creates the workspace on the other channel's server and makes General Connection Details report a false reachable state.

**Consequence, accepted:** stable and NIGHTLY remain separate choices and never fall back to one another; a live pointer is always honored, a missing selected-channel pointer blocks cross-channel discovery, and discovery remains only when no channel has a live pointer. No settings file is modified by the app.

## `cmux rpc` is the only control path, and it carries nine methods

**Revisit when:** the pinned cmux version moves — the raw v2 method names are not a stable public API

Everything the app asks of cmux goes through `cmux rpc <method> <json>`. The original four methods remain (`workspace.create`, `surface.send_text`, `surface.read_text`, `debug.terminals`), and grouped placement adds `workspace.list`, `pane.list`, `surface.list`, `surface.split`, and `surface.create`.

**Reason:** rpc is the only path that does not rewrite the payload. The parameters travel in argv because the CLI has no stdin JSON route, so non-ASCII is escaped as `\uXXXX` — Foundation re-encodes `Process.arguments` to NFD on Darwin, and a Korean or Japanese message would otherwise arrive at the terminal in a form the user never typed.

**Rejected alternative — `cmux send` / `--command`.** Both pass through `unescapeSendText`, which turns a literal `\n` into CR and does not handle `\\` at all. A user's text containing either is silently altered, and a newline submits the line early.

**Consequence, accepted:** the placement matrix below records probe coverage for cmux 0.64.22 (102) [ddd4a01bc], including capabilities measured for batch creation and layout. The method names are internal to a cmux version and are declared as constants, every failure log names the method that failed, and `docs/new-terminal-checklist.md` carries "re-verify the nine app-issued methods" as an item when the pinned version moves; probe-only methods remain explicitly marked as such in the matrix.

## Grouped placement prefers layout creation, and found workspaces use balanced target splits

**Revisit when:** cmux changes layout execution, split targeting or ordering, `operation_id` validation, or the window scope of an unaddressed `workspace.list`

Grouped placement prefers a layout-built `workspace.create` whenever it can create a workspace: always-new pane placement, fixed-name not-found pane placement, and create-based tab or workspace-per-item routes. A found fixed-name workspace cannot receive a layout after creation, so its existing first surface in `pane.index` 0 stays as depth-first leaf zero and receives no item; N item commands use the N new surfaces created by N target-addressed balanced `surface.split` calls, for N+1 leaves total. Pane-per-item requests through N=25 use panes in both new-workspace layout creation and the fixed-name found-workspace split path. Above 25, the tab-per-item guard remains for a future batch-limit increase; the current batch limit is 25, so that guard is not presently reachable.

There are two item-to-surface sources of truth. Layout-created leaves are enumerated through `pane.list` and one workspace-scoped `surface.list` call in depth-first `pane.index` order; the returned surfaces are grouped by each item's owning `pane_id` and then ordered by `index_in_pane`. cmux ignores a `pane_id` parameter on `surface.list`, so the app omits that parameter instead of treating a repeated full-workspace response as a pane filter. Found-split items use the depth-first order obtained by collecting each split response's `surface_id`. Each grouped plan carries one UUID `operation_id` for the batch and one UUID per item for workspace-per-item creates; cmux rejects a non-UUID `operation_id` (driver measurement, 2026-09-01). The response deadline is checked only immediately before an unstarted workspace-per-item create or guarded `surface.send_text`; a successful layout create has already run its inline leaf commands, so those items remain successful and are never relabeled as not launched.

**Reason:** one layout call preserves the measured balanced geometry and lets canonical-limit leaf commands run without extra sends; a found workspace has no layout-create step left, so explicit target splits are the measured way to retain pane-per-item behavior while leaving the existing pane outside the target subtree untouched. Stable operation keys make an uncertain create retry at-most-once without changing the response contract.

**Rejected alternative — build every fan-out from a split chain.** Repeated splits produce a linear width collapse instead of the measured balanced shape, and an unaddressed split can act on the current target; the layout tree is the measured one-call route for new workspaces.

**Rejected alternative — use `pane.create` for the found workspace.** The driver measurement found that its target is ignored, so it cannot establish the pane addressed by the placement contract.

**Rejected alternative — identify windows by fixed name.** The driver measurement found that `window.create` ignores `title`, while `window.list` exposes no name field to match, so v1 keeps identity at workspace level.

**Consequence, accepted:** placement paths are observable through the existing per-item timeline and `checkoutLog`, and guarded commands fail closed at the response deadline without rollback — inline leaves cannot, because the create that submitted them has already returned, which is why the seam sits in front of unstarted side effects only. The found-split order for N∈{6,7}, high-volume N=25 tab behavior, and the scope of `workspace.list` across multiple windows remain unmeasured. A live N=2 found split was measured to leave the untouched pane geometry intact and place both item markers, but nothing asserted which pane received which item. The N=25 executor results and visible-window geometry are described below; the found-split screen geometry remains unmeasured.

**Revisit when:** cmux changes targeted `surface.split` behavior or the app changes found-workspace routing or its Claude-session gate

A fixed-name workspace exists to be reused, and under the old plan its first surface usually still ran the previous batch's claude, because that batch had put its first item there. The send gate checks raw mode, which both claude and a shell prompt use, while the Claude-input path accepts the running claude PID as the prepared session. A new command can therefore arrive as a message in the old Claude session, and scheduled `!` inputs can run there. This defect existed for batches up to eight items since PR #80; raising the pane limit to 25 extended the same route to larger batches. The found plan now leaves the existing surface at depth-first leaf zero and assigns items only to surfaces created by that batch.

**Reason:** raw mode cannot establish that the existing pane is empty or distinguish a shell prompt from claude; preserving the existing surface avoids sending a batch into state left by an earlier run.

**Rejected alternative — check whether the existing surface is empty.** The raw-mode signal used by this route cannot distinguish an empty Claude composer from a shell prompt or tell which session owns the text.

**Rejected alternative — close or overwrite the existing surface.** The pane may contain user work, and placement must preserve it.

**Cost, accepted:** the original pane remains as an unassigned leaf, so its share of the balanced layout decreases as later batches add more leaves.

## A launch retry is decided by the transport failure, never by matching a message

**Revisit when:** cmux changes either connection-phase error string, or gains an exit code that distinguishes them

When an RPC fails, the app decides whether it may launch cmux and retry by asking one question: did this failure happen before the request reached the server? The app classifies two transport forms as pre-server today, both with required `Error:` prefixes:

`Error: Socket not found at <path>`
`Error: Failed to connect to socket at <path> (Connection refused, errno 61)`

A third transport form is measured before forwarding, not from the server: with `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH` pointed at a regular file, the CLI returned `Error: Path exists at <path> but is not a Unix socket`, so no server could have received the request. It is not classified today, so this path remains fail-closed even though no server effect was possible; it is a missed retry opportunity rather than a safety gap.

Measured server-side validation failures carried typed prefixes (`invalid_params:`, `not_found:`, `unavailable:`, `method_not_found:`) with body text that is locale-dependent, and they left `workspace.list` / `pane.list` / `surface.list` unchanged in the guarded checks (11→11 workspaces, 1→1 panes, 1→1 surfaces), so a typed body cannot be matched safely and this entry cannot change the placement contract on those paths: for example `Error: invalid_params: Invalid layout: 올바른 포맷이 아니기 때문에 해당 데이터를 읽을 수 없습니다.`.

**Reason:** `workspace.create` is not idempotent without `operation_id`. A retry after a request that did reach the server creates a second workspace, so the retry has to be gated on proof that nothing happened — not on a guess about what the message means. Anything else, including a message with no prefix, is treated as a failure that may have had a server-side effect, and is rethrown. Classifying by transport fact rather than by substring is also what makes the gate fail closed: a message shape we have never measured falls into "may have had an effect," which is the safe side. A call carrying a stable `operation_id` was measured to return the same `workspace_id` instead of creating a second workspace while that workspace was still live, and to return `already_completed` with no new workspace after close; #69 should therefore treat `already_completed` as terminal and not as an unconditional recoverable retry.

**Rejected alternative — substring matching.** A partial match cannot tell a connection refusal from a post-create failure that quotes the same words, and it silently starts matching different things when the wording drifts. An earlier version of this classifier also anchored on the error text *without* its `Error: ` prefix — the test passed while the real CLI output did not match, so the auto-launch path was dead. Requiring the prefix that the CLI always emits is what makes the anchor testable against something real.

**Rejected alternative — preflight with `cmux ping`.** The execution path deliberately does not ping first. `workspace.create` is tried immediately: a socket denial then fails at once with the reason the user needs, and a ping in front of it would only add a round trip and a second thing that can be wrong. General Connection Details' live status probe *does* use ping, because its question is different — it is asking about state, not performing an action.

## The workspace is created focused and unaddressed

**Revisit when:** cmux changes how an unaddressed or addressed `workspace.create` pick their window target

`workspace.create` is sent by the app with `focus:true` — `focus:false` when the user has chosen background tabs (`tab-activation.md`) — and no `window_id`; an unaddressed create follows the server's active-window pointer.

**Reason:** the server routes an unaddressed create to the most recently active window, so the new workspace appears where the user was looking. This is the same class of risk WezTerm has without `--window-id`; without that flag, `wezterm cli spawn` falls back to the mux's oldest window, while cmux does not. The conditional-fallback ladder WezTerm needed was planned for cmux, measured unnecessary here, and dropped. The new fact is that `window_id` is supported and validated: an unknown window id returns `Error: unavailable: TabManager not available` with no list delta.

**Rejected as the default — `focus:false`; kept for the background setting.** A workspace created unfocused can have no pty at all; in the measured case this yielded `tty: null` and a send `queued:true` while the surface was still runtime-active. The queued bytes are not lost — the surface flushes after warm-up, measured in this round with focus:false and focused surfaces, and `tty` appeared after the flush within measured bounds (3.7 s for a focus:false surface). With no tty there is nothing to check raw mode against, so the default stays `focus:true` and reflection checks still must precede CR. Re-measured for the background setting on the installed cmux: an unfocused create left `current-workspace` unchanged, `send_text` answered `queued:true` at 0.5s, the tty appeared at 2.1s and the queued command had run by 2.9s — the delivery's 30s tty wait covers that warm-up. A separate 25-pane background-size check on cmux 0.64.25 (2026-10-02) found every pane at cmux's default 106×39, regardless of its layout; showing the workspace briefly and switching back restored 106×39, so an unseen pane's Claude dimensions do not match its layout geometry.

**Consequence, accepted:** this feature uses the unaddressed create path for now, because active-window targeting is stable and sufficient here; the placement contract now also records `window_id` as validated support when callers can supply it, and a `focus:false` surface can still become ready after queued flush rather than being permanently unavailable.

## The tty comes from `debug.terminals`, not from the pane

**Revisit when:** cmux exposes the tty on the workspace-creation response or changes `debug.terminals` semantics

The tty name for a new surface is read by polling `debug.terminals` for the surface id as a basename that cmux's shell integration pushes up. If it never appears, the command has already started; only the claude input is given up, with a log line. Measured cases split into two shapes: an idle surface can stay `tty: null` through age 16.6 s and close with no command sent, and a command-sent surface can clear null to a tty at about 0.5 s when `queued:false` or 3.7 s when `queued:true` and focus was false, which is the contract-relevant signal for command reachability. Tty names also recycled across unrelated surfaces after close, so the name is not a stable identity.

**Rejected alternative — have the pane tell us (`tty >| file`).** It works, and it puts a line the user did not write into their shell history and leaves a file to clean up.

**Rejected alternative — infer readiness from `tty` alone.** A `tty` appearing only after command submission is not a readiness signal for a new surface, so treating `tty` as "ready" would undercount warm-up cases and mis-handle `focus:false` delays.

**Rejected alternative — read the child's environment with `ps -E`.** Measured: the environment of a system binary is not visible this way, so the token cmux exports into the pane cannot be read back out.

**Rejected alternative — read the tty off the screen.** The screen is a rendering of a session, not a fact about it.

**Consequence, accepted:** keep the existing `queued`/readback flow; add a `tty` assertion only after a command has been sent and treat null as a delayed state, not a terminal fault. The null-to-non-null transition is the contract signal for command reachability, regardless of whether the surface was created focused or not.

**Revisit when:** layout geometry, minimum shell column rules, or cmux split defaults move on this machine

At 2320 × 1382 pt and 7.5 × 15 pt cells (15 × 30 px on this 2× display), repeated `surface.split direction:right` off the newest surface halves the newest pane and does not rebalance: N=1→`2320 pt` / 308 columns, N=2→`1160,1160 pt` / `154,154`, N=3→`1160,580,580 pt` / `154,76,76`, N=4→`1160,580,290,290 pt` / `154,76,38,38`. `workspace.equalize_splits {"workspace_id":W}` changed all four widths to `580` pt, and `pane.list` columns can lag `pixel_frame`, so `pixel_frame` geometry is authoritative.

Balanced split order is different: right, down off S0, then down off the returned right surface produces four equal 1160 × 691 pt panes, 154 × 43 cells each, while right-down-right produced 1160×691 / 580×691 / 580×691 / 1160×1382 pt. A newly created pane reported `columns: null` and `rows: null` until it rendered; rendered full-width panes reported 308 columns. At N=4, a 40-character command line's 29-character marker survived the read buffer in every pane, which establishes read-buffer survival and not visual readability because reads returned lines wider than each pane's own column count; visual readability at 38 columns was not judged, and the balanced shape's readability is an inference from its 154 columns. The placement recommendation therefore treats columns per pane, not pane count, as the binding constraint. `layout` creates with `workspace.create` remain the strongest fan-out route for measured geometry because they build the whole fan-out in one call and avoid extra sends for canonical-limit text.

Layout-aware creation was also measured with item 7: `workspace.create` accepts `layout` as a method argument and one call can produce all surfaces for the fan-out, with each command executed in its own leaf surface. `workspace.create` accepts `window_id`, `focus`, `title`, `description`, `operation_id`, and `cwd`; it ignores `name` (`title` stayed `Terminal`) and does not execute `command`: issue #68 item 10 measured focused and unfocused create-with-command cases where the surface materialised and became readable at 2.1, 5.1, and 10.2 seconds, and after activation at 4.2, 8.3, and 14.4 seconds, yet never observed the command nonce, never showed a tty (remaining `tty: null`), and kept `surface.list.initial_command` as `null`; the same text delivered through `surface.send_text` did run, producing `ttys028` and appearing in `surface.read_text`. Issue #68 item 12 measured focus in layout leaves: with no focused leaf, the response returned leaf a (pane index 0), with `focus:true` on leaf c's surface dict it returned leaf c (pane index 2), and with `focus:true` on leaf c's pane dict it still returned leaf a (pane-level focus is ignored). The response returns only one `surface_id`, but it is the focused leaf surface, not inherently index 0, so callers must enumerate through `pane.list` / `surface.list` to map every leaf. Issue #68 item 13 measured `command` byte bounds on layout leaves: 1023-byte commands executed (tty `ttys011`), 1024-byte commands rendered text but never acquired a tty, and 1025-byte commands never reached submitted content at all; at most 1023 UTF-8 bytes are accepted by the layout route because cmux appends a submit byte. The 932-byte leaf command reached `ttys015`; the 1432-byte one was truncated before submission, produced no tail marker, and never reached tty. `pane.index` follows leaf order in the layout tree, depth-first, not row-major geometry; for N=4 the measured order was index0 at (240,28), index1 at (240,719), index2 at (1400,28), index3 at (1400,719) while N=7 gave a at (240,28), b at (240,719), c at (820,719), d at (1400,28), e at (1980,28), f at (1400,719), g at (1980,719). A batch can mint one `operation_id` per fan-out, which guarantees at most one creation; a lost-response retry may return the same `workspace_id` or `already_completed` with nothing to address, and #69 should treat `already_completed` as terminal.

Because `title` is supported at creation, fixed-name flows can set it in the `workspace.create` call and no longer need a create→rename round trip in the successful path.

The `surface.create` route is also end-to-end compatible with a `workspace.create` surface: issue #68 item 8 created one into an existing pane, `surface.send_text` returned `queued:true`, `debug.terminals` reported `ttys026`, and `surface.read_text` contained the sent nonce. The queued path occurred because the fresh surface was not yet warm.

The measured `layout` node shape is a branch `{"direction":"horizontal"|"vertical","children":[<node>,<node>]}` with an optional `split` field, or a leaf `{"pane":{"surfaces":[{"type":"terminal","command":"…"}]}}`; omitting `split` produced an even division, two 1160 pt panes in a 2320 pt window, and `split:0.34` and `split:0.5` both worked. A bare leaf is a valid whole layout and produced one pane whose command ran. A flat four-child node was rejected with `Error: invalid_params: Invalid layout: …`; one-child and three-child branches, `split` at 0 or 1, and out-of-range values were not tried, so the broader claim that every valid layout is a binary tree with exactly two children per branch is an inference, not an exhaustive arity or range measurement. Nesting composes: a three-pane tree with `split:0.34` and a right child split of `0.5` produced 788.8 / 765.6 / 765.6 pt panes, and the measured 2×2 produced four equal 1160 × 691 pt panes.

Issue #68 items 7 through 9 collectively created the balanced panes and checked per-surface isolation for every N=1 through N=8 in the same window and cell metrics: at every size, the number of distinct ttys equalled the pane count, every surface's read contained exactly one nonce, and no surface contained a sibling's nonce. The measured geometry is:

| N | pane sizes (pt) | columns × rows |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | 2320 × 1382 | 308 × 90 |
| 2 | 1160 × 1382 ×2 | 154 × 90 |
| 3 | 1160 × 1382, 1160 × 691 ×2 | 154 × 90, 154 × 43 |
| 4 | 1160 × 691 ×4 | 154 × 43 |
| 5 | 1160 × 691 ×3, 580 × 691 ×2 | 154 × 43, 76 × 43 |
| 6 | 1160 × 691 ×2, 580 × 691 ×4 | 154 × 43, 76 × 43 |
| 7 | 1160 × 691 ×1, 580 × 691 ×6 | 154 × 43, 76 × 43 |
| 8 | 580 × 691 ×8 | 76 × 43 |

Visible-window geometry was measured on cmux 0.64.25 on 2026-10-02 with a 2320×1382 pt window and the balanced layout for N=9∼25:

| N | observed pane grid |
|:--|:--|
| 9∼16 | Every pane was 76 columns wide; some or all were 20 rows high |
| 17∼25 | Some panes were 38×20 and others 76×20 |
| 25 | 18 panes were 38×20 and 7 panes were 76×20 |

A single `workspace.create` accepted the 25-leaf layout. On cmux 0.64.25 on 2026-10-02, the real executor `runCmuxBatch` placed 25 items in 4.4 seconds through `layoutCreate` for an always-new workspace. For a found fixed-name workspace, it placed 25 items in 5.1 seconds through `foundSplit` after 25 balanced splits, with 26 total surfaces including the existing first surface; a program reading that existing surface captured 0 bytes, and all 25 item surfaces showed only their own marker. The `layoutCreate` path preserved the `pane.index` depth-first mapping across all 25 layout leaves. Found-split visible geometry and the NIGHTLY channel remain unmeasured. For a found workspace, the calculated height reaches about 10 rows from 16 requested items (17 total leaves, including the existing pane) and can be smaller when the workspace already has multiple panes; the user chose the 25-item cap with that calculation understood.

**Reason:** a one-shot `workspace.create` with `layout` builds every pane and runs each leaf command with no extra setup calls as long as command text stays within the canonical payload limit, gives each leaf its own surface/tty and isolated output, and lets geometry come from the layout tree rather than from the order of operations; oversize content must stay on `surface.send_text` where the command gate rejects before truncation.

**Rejected alternative — build the fan-out from `surface.split` calls.** split-based fan-out repeatedly halves the current active pane so N=4 ends at 38 columns; unaddressed calls fall back to the current workspace and surface, which is the same misplacement hazard as other focus defaults; it adds N round trips plus a send per pane; and `workspace.equalize_splits` partially repairs that shape to four 76-column panes while a balanced layout keeps 154 columns. `layout` fan-out with `workspace.create` avoids that chain and keeps placement under explicit tree shape.

**Rejected alternative — `N ≤ 3`.** The earlier proposal was based on the unverified assumption that four panes lay out unreadably: the measurements show balanced 2×2 geometry with 154 columns per pane, while the linear shape has 38-column panes. The later visible-window measurements include 38×20 panes at N=17∼25, but do not establish that every pane size is comfortable for every command.

**Consequence, accepted:** the placement contract now uses column width as the gating metric for split fan-out and prefers layout-aware construction over split chains when a balanced shape is required. At this window size, balanced layouts have a narrowest pane of 154 columns for N≤4, 76 columns for N=5∼16, and 38 columns for N≥17; the original isolation checks cover N=1 through N=8, and visible-window geometry measurements extend always-new balanced placement through N=25. The found-workspace route is structurally confirmed through 25 new item surfaces (26 surfaces including the existing pane), while its pixel geometry remains unmeasured because the probe ran in the background. Equalization is a geometry normalization for a linear chain, not a readability fix: it removes the 38-column panes but yields four 580 pt / 76-column panes and does not recover the balanced 1160 pt / 154-column width; this conclusion also adds that one-call layout fans out safely only for layout leaf commands no more than 1023 UTF-8 bytes, while oversized text belongs on `surface.send_text` with the oversized-rejection gate.

## cmux's marker experiment reads its addressed surface, including in a background tab

**Id:** 0af4adab-5942-4019-9a12-3894e0285dd4
**Type:** decision
**Status:** active
**Evidence:** confirmed
**Evidence note:** in cmux 0.64.22 (102) [ddd4a01bc]; issue #68 item 6; delivery continuing after the user switched to another tab was measured with PR #60; that every input runs the marker experiment is read from the code
**Source:** `proveOurPaneAndEmptyBox` and `inputBoxAfterSubmit` in `app/Sources/Core/ClaudeInjector.swift`; `surface.read_text` implementation in `app/Sources/Core/CmuxControl.swift`; issue #68 item 6 and PR #60; https://github.com/dazebug/terminal-checkout/issues/68#issuecomment-5487928294
**Revisit when:** `surface.read_text` no longer accepts an explicit surface id, or the marker experiment or `screenNeedsPaneProof` contract changes

`proveOurPaneAndEmptyBox` runs before every input on all terminals. It uses a throwaway marker to verify the screen and input-box attribution; on cmux, `screenNeedsPaneProof` is false and `surface.read_text` takes the explicit surface UUID, so that experiment reads the intended pane while its tab is in the background. The flag does not select whether to run the marker experiment: it makes `inputBoxAfterSubmit` skip its post-CR screen read and participates in Warp's Accessibility check.

**Reason:** the marker experiment is needed on every terminal to attribute text to the input box and confirm the clear; an addressed cmux screen also identifies which pane was read, while Warp's focused-pane-only Accessibility read still requires the user to look at that tab.

**Consequence, accepted:** the surface id must still be passed explicitly on every read — omitting it falls back to the focused surface, which is exactly the ambiguity the marker experiment must detect. A prior in-repo observation saw cold reads erroring as `internal_error`; the same continuous server measured both states: with no send, issue #68 item 6 returned exit 1 with `Error: internal_error: Failed to read terminal text`, while after a send that returned `queued:true`, issue #68 item 6 returned exit 0 with `text` equal to the queued payload itself. Therefore an unready surface with nothing queued errors, while an unready surface with queued content echoes the queue. Neither result proves that the TUI rendered anything, and the existing handling maps a read failure to "could not read", never to "nothing is there". Sends and reads are asymmetric here: a send to a not-yet-warm surface can return either `queued:false` or `queued:true`, while a read can return the queued payload before the surface is ready; only `queued:true` establishes queued delivery. In background fan-out, all four sent surfaces returned `queued:false`, each acquired a distinct tty within 3 s while unfocused, and each `surface.read_text` returned only its own nonce; `/bin/stty -f /dev/ttysNNN -a` reported `43 rows; 154 columns; -icanon -echo` on each.

Measured in cmux 0.64.22 (102) [ddd4a01bc], `window.create` also creates a default workspace, so closing only the workspaces deliberately created by a caller leaves that default one behind and the window remains in `window.list` with `visible:false`; closing that last workspace removed the window within 0.5 s, explaining the previously unexplained leftover state.

## Placement contract matrix for cmux 0.64.22 (102) [ddd4a01bc]

This matrix records the measured cmux 0.64.22 (102) [ddd4a01bc] RPC surface used by issue #69's batch fan-out. The app now issues the nine methods in the control-path decision (`workspace.create`, `surface.send_text`, `surface.read_text`, `debug.terminals`, `workspace.list`, `pane.list`, `surface.list`, `surface.split`, and `surface.create`); probe-only methods remain in the matrix and are marked as not used by placement, while each shipped row describes the current v1 behavior.

| capability | method and parameters | identifier or tty guarantee | retry class | condition | v1 placement use |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| window-addressed create | `workspace.create` with `window_id` and optional `focus` / `operation_id` | returns `workspace_id` and `window_id`; unknown `window_id` rejects with `Error: unavailable: TabManager not available` and no list delta | unkeyed calls use a fail-closed floor plus method-level validation; no retry on validation errors; a matching `operation_id` can be retried while that workspace is still live and returns the same `workspace_id`, or return `already_completed` when the workspace is already closed | address only by probing membership in the target `window_id` | use when the caller can resolve and require deterministic window placement |
| layout-built fan-out create | `workspace.create` with `layout` plus optional `window_id`, `title`, `description`, `cwd`, `focus`, `operation_id` | returns the focused leaf `surface_id` only; enumerate `pane.list`/`surface.list` for all surfaces; `surface.list.initial_command` is null | unkeyed calls stay on the same fail-closed floor; a matching `operation_id` can be retried safely while the first workspace is still live and returns the same `workspace_id`, and returns `already_completed` with no new workspace after close; oversized-content handling remains on `surface.send_text` | measured two-child branches with `direction`; omitted `split` divided evenly; `split:0.34` and `split:0.5` worked; a flat four-child node was rejected; other arities and ranges were not measured, so the binary-tree model is an inference | measured always-new pane layout through N=25; found-workspace N=25 creates 25 item surfaces plus the existing surface (26 total), with visible geometry unmeasured; one RPC creates new-workspace panes and geometry, while oversized leaf commands must use guarded `surface.send_text` |
| workspace lookup | `workspace.list` with no parameters | returns `workspaces[]`; placement reads each item's `id`, `index`, `custom_title`, and `has_custom_title` | no placement retry; lookup is part of the current-window identity contract | an unaddressed call returns the current window's workspaces | match only custom-titled workspaces and choose the lowest `index` |
| pane enumeration | `pane.list` with `workspace_id` | returns `panes[]`; placement reads each item's `id` and `index` | no placement retry | the workspace target is honored, unlike `surface.list`'s `pane_id`: the addressed call returned the target's 2 panes while the unaddressed call returned the current workspace's 3 (driver measurement, 2026-09-01), so scoping is measured per parameter and never assumed from a sibling method | order panes by the measured `index` sequence before surface grouping |
| surface enumeration | `surface.list` with `workspace_id` only; `pane_id` is omitted because the server ignores it (driver measurement, 2026-09-01) | returns workspace-wide `surfaces[]`; placement reads each item's `id`, `index_in_pane`, and owning `pane_id` (driver measurement, 2026-09-01) | no placement retry | one call per workspace, then client-side grouping by `pane_id`; invalid per-pane index sequences fail closed | reconstruct pane-index then in-pane order for layout leaf mapping and found-root lookup |
| `surface.split` | `surface.split` with `direction` and optional `workspace_id`/`surface_id` | returns new `pane_id`, `surface_id` with updated panes list; `direction` required, unknown ids return `not_found` | server-side typed prefixes (`invalid_params:`, `not_found:`) are terminal; transport pre-forward failures are handled by the transport floor: `Socket not found` and `Failed to connect` may retry, `Path exists` remains fail-closed | explicit handles are required to avoid current-focus fallback; unaddressed calls split the current surface | use only with explicit current-target resolution and fallback accounted for |
| `surface.create` | `surface.create` with optional `type` / `workspace_id` / `pane_id` | returns `pane_id`, `pane_ref`, `surface_id`, `surface_ref`, `type`, `window_id`, `window_ref`, `workspace_id`, and `workspace_ref`; `index_in_pane` is observed only in a later `surface.list`; issue #68 item 8 also confirmed a tty and addressed readback after a send | same floor; missing params are valid defaults | creates a tab in an existing pane, does not create a new pane; a fresh surface can take the queued path before tty acquisition | use when caller needs another surface in one pane |
| `surface.new_terminal` | `surface.new_terminal` with `pane_id` and optional `type` | method is `method_not_found`; command is absent from `capabilities.json` and returns no identifiers | no retry; unsupported method | no supported probe target; command stays unsupported | do not route placement paths here |
| `workspace.rename` | `workspace.rename` with `workspace_id` and `title` | returns the requested `workspace_id`; list shows `title` and `has_custom_title: true` | same floor; `not_found` or `invalid_params` are terminal for that call | unknown `workspace_id` fails; `title` required | set `title` at create time when possible; use rename for post-create reconciliation where the caller could not set it |
| `workspace.equalize_splits` | `workspace.equalize_splits` with `workspace_id` | returns `{equalized:true, workspace_id, workspace_ref}`; pane pixel geometry becomes equalized | same floor; validation/no-found failures are terminal | only meaningful for split-heavy layouts; `pane.list` columns can lag pixel frames, so `pixel_frame` geometry is authoritative | use to normalize a linear split chain and remove 38-column panes; it does not recover the balanced shape's width |
| `workspace.close` | `workspace.close` with `workspace_id` | removes the workspace from subsequent `workspace.list` results | same floor; `not_found` and validation are terminal | deterministic cleanup target | use as standard per-measurement cleanup boundary |
| `window.close` | `window.close` with `window_id` | closes window only when its final workspace is gone; otherwise it remains in `window.list` with `visible:false` | same floor; validation/no_found terminal | visible windows may need workspace-level cleanup first to remove from topology | avoid for placement; use for targeted test/window cleanup |
| `surface.send_text` | `surface.send_text` with `surface_id` and `text` | response includes `queued` plus IDs; a null tty does not determine queued delivery, and `queued:true` indicates pending delivery rather than loss | not measured for this issue | with `tty:null` immediately beforehand, measured responses included `queued:false` for a focused create and `queued:true` for an unfocused create; only `queued:true` establishes queued delivery, and the tty appeared after the send in both cases | do not infer safe retries; the existing no-retype contract governs command delivery |
| `surface.read_text` | `surface.read_text` with `surface_id` (or default/focused) | response includes `text`; an unready surface with no queued content errors, while queued content can be echoed before tty exists; neither is a render confirmation | no retry behavior in placement contract; read result becomes an observation point | no send: exit 1 with `Error: internal_error: Failed to read terminal text`; queued send: exit 0 with `text` equal to the queued payload | use queued content only as readback, not as TUI-provenance proof |
| `debug.terminals` | `debug.terminals` with no params | returns `surface_id` entries with `tty`, and the value is a bare `ttysNNN` basename | no retry gate for placement; no transport failure branch here | `tty` can be null through warm-up and appears only after command submission; values can be recycled across surfaces | use for readiness polling and mapping surface IDs to terminal names |
